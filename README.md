* Explored the best diabetes readmission rate predictors (“readmitted”)
* Analyzed the rudimentary information of patients, medications and laboratory tests taken during the diabetic encounter to identify patients with worse treatment outcomes and made them targeted to interventions to improve their outcomes and reduce costs by fewer readmission
* Performed diagnostic check
* Interpreted the final model and discussed limitations and potentials
